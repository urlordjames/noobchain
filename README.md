# noobchain
a POC for a blockchain based message board
# information
noobchain is a proof of work/blockchain based message board
we do not have any security or sanitization as of yet so if you wanna try and hack me go nuts
I may attempt to add a system where the difficulty can be adjusted
to send autistic messages download the miner.py file in this repo
there is a message limit of 100 characters, there is no indication of this in miner.py
be aware that sending messages over 100 characters is a waste of time and computing power
# install
